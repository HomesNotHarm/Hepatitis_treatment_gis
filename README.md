This is my atempt at mapping hepatitis treatment centers. I'm starting in Georgia where info is being extracted from this "HCV Funding Opportunity Annoucement - Final.pdf".which  will be uploaded and contains acknowledgment for the research the information will be uploaded in csv file format and will be geocoded threw the  us census geocoding api
.
This project is intended to help people suffering from hepatitis also to raise awareness of a family of deadly disease that are not talked about enough. I also hope to gather tools that can help make this easier for similar projects.

Any contributions are greatly appreciated I'll post the schema I'm using if anyone has any suggestions earlier the better won't have to change more later thank you .
